# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository is created to explore and document the process of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It covers the key activities involved — such as requirement gathering, elicitation, documentation, modeling, and validation — providing a foundational understanding of how clear, accurate, and prioritized requirements contribute to the success of software projects.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on understanding and defining what the users need from a software system.  
It involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, analyzing them to ensure clarity and feasibility, documenting them in a structured format, and validating them to confirm alignment with business goals.

### **Key Objectives of Requirement Analysis**
- To identify the **needs, expectations, and constraints** of the users and stakeholders.  
- To ensure that the **software requirements** are complete, consistent, and unambiguous.  
- To create a **clear foundation** for system design, development, and testing.  
- To minimize misunderstandings and reduce the risk of costly rework later in the development process.

### **Importance in the SDLC**
Requirement Analysis serves as the **blueprint** for the entire software project. Without well-defined requirements, the development process can face challenges such as scope creep, delays, or misaligned outcomes.  
By conducting thorough analysis:
- Developers know **what to build**.  
- Testers know **what to verify**.  
- Stakeholders understand **what to expect**.  

In short, Requirement Analysis ensures that the final software product meets the intended goals, functions efficiently, and satisfies user needs — making it one of the most essential phases in the SDLC.
