# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository is created to explore and document the process of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It covers the key activities involved — such as requirement gathering, elicitation, documentation, modeling, and validation — providing a foundational understanding of how clear, accurate, and prioritized requirements contribute to the success of software projects.
